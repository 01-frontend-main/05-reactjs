## What make ReactJS fast?

### 1. Virtual DOM

- Instead of directly manipulating the DOM, React creates an `in-memory` representation of the DOM, known as the `Virtual DOM`
- When the `state changes`
  . React first `updates the Virtual DOM`
  . Compares the `new Virtual DOM` with the `previous version` (this process is called `reconciliation`)
  . Calculates the `minimum set of changes` required to `update the actual DOM`

### 2. Reconciliation (Efficient Diffing Algorithm)

- Reconciliation is `the process` React uses to `update the DOM`
- React `performs a diffing algorithm` that `compares the new Virtual DOM` with the `previous one` to find `differences` (or "diffs") and figure out the `most efficient way` to update the real DOM

### 3. Batching State Updates

- If `multiple state changes` are triggered `within a single event` (user input, network request), React will `process those updates` in `one go`, instead of making separate

### 4. Re-rendering Optimization

- React.memo, useMemo, useCallback

### 5. Lazy Loading of Components

- `React.lazy` and `Suspense enable` lazy loading of components
- It separate the bundle into `smaller chunks`, `reducing the initial load time` and making the app feel faster
