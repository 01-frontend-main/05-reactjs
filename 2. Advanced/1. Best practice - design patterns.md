## Best Practice

### 1. Component Design and Structure

- Children components should be `nested to Parent components`
- If components get `too big`, split it into `smaller components`
- Name your components `based on their purpose` (e.g., UserProfile, ProductCard))

### 2. State Management

- `Lift State Up When Necessary`: lift the state up to the nearest common ancestor component if multiple components need the same state
- `Avoid Props Drilling`: Instead of `passing props down many levels`, use the `Context API` or `state management solutions`

## 3. Hooks Best Practices

- `Custom Hooks`: Consider split a common logic to custom Hooks

## 4. Error Handling

- `Error Boundaries`: gracefully `handle JavaScript errors` and `prevent the app from crashing`
